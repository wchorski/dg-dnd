It is nestled in the White River valley, a sleepy community of small villages and independent homesteads that nominally is under the banner of a Baron. This family has ruled since ancient times, claiming descendancy from an ancient empire that once ruled a vast swath of the world‚Ä¶ whether its true or not is unknown, but the Barony of Harkenwold has held sway for at least the last century. Out of the way and without great wealth, much of the outside world ignores the Harkenwold Vale and many of the residents are happy to have it as such.\n\n[8:11 PM]\nSages and travelers say that Harkenwold is simply one piece of a great land, known in ancient times as the Nentir. An ancient name, it stretches from the Dawnforge Mountains in the east, to the Stonemarch Mountains far to the northwest, while the great Winterbole Forest is many hundreds of miles north from the Harken Forest. Some claim that all the land was once a vast forest before it was cut in two, but that would have been millenia ago and so most pay it no mind.",

Sibbi Salar is the patriarch and nominal¬†ealdorman when needed, and his half-dozen children help run the business and the inn. There is also a mason's workshop, where stone is carved and used to maintain the three bridges that afford travel along the important road from Albridge to Marl. A pair of masons, a human named Grant the Elder and a dwarf from the east, Bolden Stonebeard, work the shop and also send surplus stone to the town of Marl in the south. The central &quot;village&quot; has about a dozen buildings and maybe fifty residents, with an equal number living nearby on farmsteads and outlying cabins. Perhaps two of the most notable of these distant relatives are the ranger Willam Wild, a taciturn woodsman¬†who many say once fought in wars to the northwest, and the herbalist Lewellyn, a beautiful but quiet elven druid who once roamed with the Woodsinger clans. The only other citizen of note is Oben Jakes, the owner of a small watermill near the bridge and the only tiefling in the settlement. Some say he is a foul warlock who charges too much to use his mill, but he is always quiet and takes delight in entertaining children with small illusion magics.\n\nFebruary 21, 2022",

The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round. ‚Ä¢ You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom. ‚Ä¢ You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube. ‚Ä¢ You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\nPoison Spray\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1\n10ft\nV, S\ninst\n\nYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage. This spell‚Äôs damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).\nProduce Flame\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1\n120ft\nV, S\n1rnd\n\nA flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again. You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nChill Touch\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1\nself\nV, S\n1 rnd\n\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nCharm Person\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1 act\n30ft\nV, S\n1 hr\n\nYou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nThunderwave\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1 act\nself\nV, S\ninst\n\nA wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st\nHold Person\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1 act\n60ft\nV, S, M\nConc, 1 min\n\nChoose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nLocate Object\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1 act\nself\nV, S, M\nConc, 10 min\n\nDescribe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close‚Äîwithin 30 feet‚Äîat least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon. This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object\nSpike Growth\n\nact\ndistance\ncomponents\ntiming\n\n1 act\n150ft\nV, S, M\nConc, 10 min\n\nThe ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.",
