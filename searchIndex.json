It is nestled in the White River valley, a sleepy community of small villages and independent homesteads that nominally is under the banner of a Baron. This family has ruled since ancient times, claiming descendancy from an ancient empire that once ruled a vast swath of the world… whether its true or not is unknown, but the Barony of Harkenwold has held sway for at least the last century. Out of the way and without great wealth, much of the outside world ignores the Harkenwold Vale and many of the residents are happy to have it as such.\n\n[8:11 PM]\nSages and travelers say that Harkenwold is simply one piece of a great land, known in ancient times as the Nentir. An ancient name, it stretches from the Dawnforge Mountains in the east, to the Stonemarch Mountains far to the northwest, while the great Winterbole Forest is many hundreds of miles north from the Harken Forest. Some claim that all the land was once a vast forest before it was cut in two, but that would have been millenia ago and so most pay it no mind.",

Sibbi Salar is the patriarch and nominal ealdorman when needed, and his half-dozen children help run the business and the inn. There is also a mason's workshop, where stone is carved and used to maintain the three bridges that afford travel along the important road from Albridge to Marl. A pair of masons, a human named Grant the Elder and a dwarf from the east, Bolden Stonebeard, work the shop and also send surplus stone to the town of Marl in the south. The central &quot;village&quot; has about a dozen buildings and maybe fifty residents, with an equal number living nearby on farmsteads and outlying cabins. Perhaps two of the most notable of these distant relatives are the ranger Willam Wild, a taciturn woodsman who many say once fought in wars to the northwest, and the herbalist Lewellyn, a beautiful but quiet elven druid who once roamed with the Woodsinger clans. The only other citizen of note is Oben Jakes, the owner of a small watermill near the bridge and the only tiefling in the settlement. Some say he is a foul warlock who charges too much to use his mill, but he is always quiet and takes delight in entertaining children with small illusion magics.\n\nFebruary 21, 2022",
