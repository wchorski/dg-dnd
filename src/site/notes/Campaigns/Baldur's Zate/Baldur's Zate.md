1. Welcome to Baldur's Gate: a wretched hive of scum and villainy. The city is "protected" by [[Campaigns/Baldur's Zate/Locations/The Flaming Fist\|Campaigns/Baldur's Zate/Locations/The Flaming Fist]], a military police force that walks both sides of the law depending on who you ask. The Fist is led by [[Campaigns/Baldur's Zate/NPCs/Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard\|Campaigns/Baldur's Zate/NPCs/Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard]]. Ravengard is an honorable man, but the Flaming Fist have been known to be cruel. Despite some bad apples, there are members who genuinely wish to help and protect the citizens of Baldur's Gate. As the newest recruits, your party is put out on the front lines to learn the beats of the streets.

    Bribery and theft have always been plagues of the city, but lately there has been an increase in reports of violence and murder, even rumors of necromancy. Citizens claim there is a secret cult operating in the shadows beneath the city, driving the corruption and sin flowing through the streets. Most concerning is a steady rise in the occurrence of three different symbols found at the crime scenes, correlated to an equal rise in brutality. With all the unrest, people are starting to question if the Flaming Fist can do their jobs keeping the peace.

    Grand Duke Ravengard has connected you with [[Tarina\|Tarina]], an informant and seemingly ally of the Flaming Fist. She has information on where the cultâ€™s hideout might be, as well as who might be funding them and ultimately pulling the strings. The party can connect with Tarina at the [[Campaigns/Baldur's Zate/Locations/Low Lantern\|Campaigns/Baldur's Zate/Locations/Low Lantern]], a converted three-mast ship reborn as a tavern and gambling house in Baldur's Gate.
