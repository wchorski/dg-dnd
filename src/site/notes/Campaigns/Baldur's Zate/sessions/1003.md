## party is still split

- party joins back together
- we follow the last path that hasn't been explored
- it reeks a foul stench
- door #2 a mummy with gold coins and 2 rubies is found
- door #3, bunch of undead creatures found (seemingling docile)
- door $4, 2 hostages chained to the wall
	- the bodies are lifeless.
	- A special door to the north wall is opened revealing a narrow passage
- another split path
	- north east, 
		- dead prisoner in a bloody broth grave
		- an alive prisoner "please don't hurt me"
	- south east
		- 4 cultists in full garb ready to fight
		- the alive prisoner runs away
		- 4 cultists have been defeated
	- south west
		- sarcophagus with many pillars of torches surrounding 
		- nothing is found
- head back the way we came
	- one of the chained prisoners shows sliver of life
	- given water and food
	- distraught and weak, not very informative
	- takes us to a wall with a carved skull in the stone
	- the rubies fit into the eye holes and reveals a secret passage
	- Long pathway leads us to the clanging
