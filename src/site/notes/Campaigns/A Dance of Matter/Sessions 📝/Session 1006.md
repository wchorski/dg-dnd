## inside Thunderspire

The party still finds themselves deep inside [Thunderspire](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Landmarks%20â›°/Thunderspire.md). After the hostile encounter with [Jindosh the Alchemist](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/Jindosh%20the%20Alchemist.md) We tumble deeper into the cave. 

- The cave is pitch black
- a dead [Kyton Devil](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/Kyton%20Devil.md) lies cold on the ground
- red ruby dust was discovered on the ground
- a Giant tentacle Monster emerges from the water
	- monster is harpooned by [Lucas](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20ðŸ‘¤/Lucas.md) and pulled to shore
	- another tentacle monster emerges from the darkness
	- 3 total octopus monsters surround the party
	- [Christina Ashworth](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/Christina%20Ashworth.md) shoots fire to create a barrier between us and more octopus monsters
	- She convinces us to run with her to find safety from the un-ending onslaught of enemies 
- we find rest in a small corner of the cave
	- she makes mentions of a clan called [Twisted Rune](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Clans%20âš”/Twisted%20Rune.md)
