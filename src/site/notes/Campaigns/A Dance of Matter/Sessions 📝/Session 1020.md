- we let the #teethlings go 
- we dip out of town before big baddies come in

## Winter is here
- the team weathers a strong snow storm
- aurora like lights fill the sky
	- we follow 
	- a small cottage is found on the way
	- we talk to dog
	- "his job to guard ducks"
	- we stealth up to the cottage
	- we great a young girl. she is also confused about the mysterious lights
	- The people who go visit these lights loose all personality and act like lumps
	- the healthy villagers take care of these vegetative friends & family
