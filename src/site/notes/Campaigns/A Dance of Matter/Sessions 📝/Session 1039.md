## Long Rest

## Into the Portal
- the air is dry and hot
- hellish scenery haze

The ground shifts and rocks the party in a large tremor. The party looks down to see a large crab leg.

A warrior character [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/NPCs 🤖/Owl Samurai\|Owl Samurai]] confronts the party. It unrolls a scroll covered in never before scene runes and mutters a few words.

[[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Locations 📌/Gehenna\|Gehenna]]: A whole civilization of these owl beings are discovered in this new land. Massive towers, river and trees, urban area.

They ask how we opened the portal and where the other end is? We give a somewhat unsatisfactory answer but the Owls still accept and move on.
## Rest
The party finds a inn to rest. They plan to explore a bit of the town come next morning.
## Level Up
The Party is now `level 12`
