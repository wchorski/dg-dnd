- last of the winter rains before the snow
- We drop in on [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/NPCs 🤖/Christina Ashworth\|Christina Ashworth]] as she is working on something
	- **Christina** - "someone has summoned an imp, and I don't know who"
	- teethlings
		- Liza - the one in charge
		- Jenny - 
		- Ron - gotee, jawnty, velvate cape, rapier 
- Goliaths have been sighted poking out of the southern forest line just below the city of [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Locations 📌/Harken\|Harken]]

- frost is finally setting into town
- a sighting of an [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/NPCs 🤖/OwlBear\|OwlBear]] has been made to the east on [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Landmarks ⛰/Kings Road\|Kings Road]]
- a dead  **ranger sentry** was found near the site.
- we've arrived at the scene of the crime
- [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Players 👤/Broly\|Broly]] didn't find any tracks (strange that not even a scavenger came to pick at the body)
