## Setting
- still in [Harken](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Locations%20ðŸ“Œ/Harken.md)
- last of the winter rains before the snow
- We drop in on [Christina Ashworth](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/Christina%20Ashworth.md) as she is working on something
	- **Christina** - "someone has summoned an imp, and I don't know who"
	- teethlings
		- Liza - the one in charge
		- Jenny - 
		- Ron - gotee, jawnty, velvate cape, rapier 
- Goliaths have been sighted poking out of the southern forest line just below the city of [Harken](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Locations%20ðŸ“Œ/Harken.md)
- we invest a lump sum into a local shrine
- [Grimjaw](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/Grimjaw.md) speaks of [Lisette](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/Lisette.md) as she is still doing fine, but has heard some of the others reside in [Winterhaven](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Locations%20ðŸ“Œ/Winterhaven.md)
- frost is finally setting into town
- a sighting of an [OwlBear](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20ðŸ¤–/OwlBear.md) has been made to the east on [Kings Road](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Landmarks%20â›°/Kings%20Road.md)
- a dead  **ranger sentry** was found near the site.
- we've arrived at the scene of the crime
- [Broly](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20ðŸ‘¤/Broly.md) didn't find any tracks (strange that not even a scavenger came to pick at the body)
- We blaze the trail of [Kings Road](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Landmarks%20â›°/Kings%20Road.md) in search of more clues
- [Silver Liota](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20ðŸ‘¤/Silver%20Liota.md) transform into an owl and eavesdrops on the camp nearby
- they seem to mean all business, armed in fur and leather
- they admit to killing the elf 
- they talk of slaying a beast
