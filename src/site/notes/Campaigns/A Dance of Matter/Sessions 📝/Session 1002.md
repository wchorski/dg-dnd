- boys are back in town
- [Bromdan](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20ðŸ‘¤/Bromdan.md) gives the party special gifts (of armor and weapons)
- leaving Dawnforge Moutains, we set up camp at the base of the mountain
- we travel the northern road and run into a man
	- we talk about Centaurs
- now we run into an obelisk
	- polished side
	- etched in dwarven runes

## Goblin Ambush
- many small goblins
- a handful of mounted goblins
- chanting "meat, meat, meat"
- with only slight damage, we wipe out the ambush
