- [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Players 👤/Lucas\|Lucas]] joins the fight. Hearty and ready to fight after a long holiday

## travel North on the suggestion of a magic 'load stone'
- [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Items 💍/Load Stone\|Load Stone]]
- a strange noise is happening in the distance
- [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Players 👤/Broly\|Broly]] pears over the hill and sees a large creature [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/NPCs 🤖/Large Reptillian Creature aka The UnderTroller\|Large Reptillian Creature aka The UnderTroller]]
	- blunt wide head
	- reptilian
	- gorilla like arms with claws
	- skin is like rock
	- pot belly (lighter in color)
- Beyond the Large creature, another somewhat smaller [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/NPCs 🤖/Green Troll aka Trollkind\|Green Troll aka Trollkind]]
- the 2 trolls exchange blows
- The Large troll engages the Players
- [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Players 👤/Bromdan\|Bromdan]] attacks the **Large Troll** with "Warhammer"
- the creature's regeneration stops (just for the turn)
- pretty much burned the Large Troll alive
- [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/Players 👤/Lucas\|Lucas]] finds a **ring with large ruby, gold chain, small gems** attached to a dead dwarf 
- we retrieve the skull of the [[Campaigns/A Dance of Matter/NPCs 🤖/Large Reptillian Creature aka The UnderTroller\|Large Reptillian Creature aka The UnderTroller]] to show proof that the Troll has been slain.
