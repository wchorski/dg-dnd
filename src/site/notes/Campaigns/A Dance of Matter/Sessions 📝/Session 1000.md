- [Lucas](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20👤/Lucas.md) joins the fight. Hearty and ready to fight after a long holiday

## travel North on the suggestion of a magic 'load stone'
- [Load Stone](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Items%20💍/Load%20Stone.md)
- a strange noise is happening in the distance
- [Broly](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20👤/Broly.md) pears over the hill and sees a large creature [Large Reptillian Creature aka The UnderTroller](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20🤖/Large%20Reptillian%20Creature%20aka%20The%20UnderTroller.md)
	- blunt wide head
	- reptilian
	- gorilla like arms with claws
	- skin is like rock
	- pot belly (lighter in color)
- Beyond the Large creature, another somewhat smaller [Green Troll aka Trollkind](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20🤖/Green%20Troll%20aka%20Trollkind.md)
- the 2 trolls exchange blows
- The Large troll engages the Players
- [Bromdan](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20👤/Bromdan.md) attacks the **Large Troll** with "Warhammer"
- the creature's regeneration stops (just for the turn)
- pretty much burned the Large Troll alive
- [Lucas](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/Players%20👤/Lucas.md) finds a **ring with large ruby, gold chain, small gems** attached to a dead dwarf 
- we retrieve the skull of the [Large Reptillian Creature aka The UnderTroller](Campaigns/A%20Dance%20of%20Matter/NPCs%20🤖/Large%20Reptillian%20Creature%20aka%20The%20UnderTroller.md) to show proof that the Troll has been slain.
