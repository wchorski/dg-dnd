> _Glamerweave_ is clothing imbued with harmless illusory magic. While wearing the common version of these clothes, you can use a bonus action to create a moving illusory pattern within the cloth.

> Uncommon _glamerweave_ can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a _glamerweave_ gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a _glamerweave_ hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.

> When you make a Charisma (Performance) or Charisma (Persuasion) check while wearing the uncommon version of _glamerweave_, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
