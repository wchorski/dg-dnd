When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
