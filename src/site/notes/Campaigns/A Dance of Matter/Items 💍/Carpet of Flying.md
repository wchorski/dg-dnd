_Wondrous item, very rare_  

You can speak the carpet's command word as an [action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_20) to make the carpet hover and [fly](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_17). It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.  
  
Four sizes of _carpet of flying_ exist. The GM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|d100|**Size**|**Capacity**|**Flying Speed**|
|01-20|3 ft. x 5 ft.|200 lb.|80 feet|
|21-55|4 ft. x 6 ft.|400 lb.|60 feet|
|56-80|5 ft. x 7 ft.|600 lb.|40 feet|
|81-100|6 ft. x 9 ft.|800 lb.|30 feet|

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half [speed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=0#toc_1) if it carries more than its normal capacity.
