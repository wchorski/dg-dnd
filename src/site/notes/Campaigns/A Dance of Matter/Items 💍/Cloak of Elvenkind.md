Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)

[Cloak of Elvenkind - Magic Items - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4606-cloak-of-elvenkind)

> While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Notes: Advantage: Stealth, Deception, Outerwear
